# BIM3008-Assignment

This folder includes assignments for BIM3008 Machine Learning for Computational Biology.

`A1` contains the answers of some questions in the textbook *Introduction to Machine Learning, third edition* by Ethem Alpaydin (pure writing, no coding). 

`A2` also contains answers of some questions to the textbook. The answer contains writing (formula deduction) and coding parts (build model to illustrate concepts on generated data).

`A3` is a machine learning project which uses RNA-seq data to predict cancer stages. 

`A4` is a report / reflection on AlphaFold.

`A5` is another machine learning project which uses multi-omics data (RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and microRNA) to predict breast cancer stages.
